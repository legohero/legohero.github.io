			Hello Dr. Reesha M. Adamson,<br/><br/>

			My name is Ganbaatar Purevdorj, I go by Joey. I am applying for the Graduate Assistant Position for Summer 2020. I am thrilled to see this position available because I think I will be an excellent candidate.<br/><br/>

			I am currently pursuing my Master of Business Administration degree and am expected to graduate in May 2021. I have added data analytics, management, and leadership certificate to go along with my master’s degree, which extended my graduation date a bit. Prior to this, I have graduated from Missouri State University in 2017 with BS - Computer Information Systems.<br/><br/>

			I have been working as a graduate assistant in COE Dean’s office since August 2019, but because of budget cuts due to the pandemic, the COE Dean’s office will no longer have graduate assistants starting Summer 2020. During my current employment in CEO Dean’s office, I have gained experience in Web Press and helped update many out of date pages on the COE website.<br/><br/>

			During my studies in the undergraduate degree, I have gained extensive knowledge of web design including HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, and SQL. I have learned a lot about Microsoft Office beyond basic functions such as making a macro and even visual basic to edit the macro to fine-tune the automation further. I have been interested in graphic design from when I was young and have learned how to use Adobe Photoshop on my own. I have even considered pursuing a degree in graphics design, but I decided I have a better future in software and web development. To demonstrate my knowledge of photoshop which could come in handy for creating and editing documents, pamphlets, and flyers, I took the liberty of making my resume and cover letter in photoshop, I hope you do not mind. I have also made a website for this application to demonstrate my web design/HTML knowledge, you can find it on  <a href="index.html" target="_self">www.ganbaatar.info/clse</a>. I also think I am a good problem solver because if there is anything I do not know, I enjoy learning about it and take pride in solving the problem and learning new things.<br/><br/>

			After reviewing my application, I hope you agree that I am the candidate you are looking for. I would be happy to elaborate on how my skills and abilities will benefit the Web Strategy and Development Office. Please contact me at (417) 619 8278 or via email at <a href="mailto:joey789@live.missouristate.edu">joey789@live.missouristate.edu</a>.<br/><br/>

			I would be honored to be considered as a candidate because I think of MSU as a second home, everything I have mentioned above I have learned here, and working at MSU would be a way for me to give back to this amazing community. Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br/><br/>
